# Cache Cleaner By $ankey
🚀 Say Goodbye to Manual Cache Cleanup! 🧹💻
Let’s face it: with every click and connection, our laptops and PCs accumulate a mountain of cache files. From browsing the web to running apps, these tiny files can clog up your system, slow down your boot times, and eat up precious storage.

But who wants to manually clean up cache every week? Running through commands, cleaning Prefetch, and launching disk utilities like cleanmgr is time-consuming, tedious, and honestly... pretty boring.
